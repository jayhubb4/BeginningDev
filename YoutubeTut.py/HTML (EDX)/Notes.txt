<!DOCTYPE html> shows what version of html you are running
<h1> the 'h' stands for heading and the number 1 stands for the largest possible heading 
The image or <img> has a few required attributes just like lang = "eng"
    Also for the image attribute, you have to specify where on your PC the file is located. So, if possible, place a local copy of an image inside thee folder where your repo is. And
    HTML requires that an alternative text be written if the image cannot be shown like "alt="Cat". To change the dimensions of an image, specify it in the code.
    There is no closing tag needed like the others. 
<a href = "" The 'a' specifies anchor which means it's seating an sttribute and href stands for hyperlink reference. You can link to an actual webpage or a file such as your image by 
using chevelless.html for example.
If you are building a webpage and you want to have users type in a password, if you simply use the 'type="password"' attribute, then the interpreter will know not to display the 
user's password onscreen.
Css works inside of html, meaning in the same logic or code you write for html, you CAN use CSS's "properties" (like HTML's attributes). These properties are colors, transitions, etc.
    See style.html for the example on how to write this.
        You can also create a .css file to apply properties to multiple webpages. This file, however, cannot be opened as a webpage like you could a an HTML file.
    You would need to link this .css file to your html file.
        See style.html and styles.css
the "<div>" attribute in HTML is simply one that places conent in sections of a page. Organization.
'Padding' is space for elements
'Margin' will move the entire element you are constructing and add space around the element and keep spacing for other nearby elements.
Css can change fonts as well. when using 'font-family' use commas to separate and specify different fonts for backup fonts just in case a user's web browser doesn't support the
font you've listed.
    'font-weight' specifies boldness maybe even italic.
Borders can be specified like this for example:
    border: 3px solid black;
AN 'id' attribute means giving something a unique name kind of like creating a variable. And to avoid having to constantly create variables, you create a 'class'.
    to call an id you would use the # sign.
CSS specificities rules in order are inline, id, class, type. So if you call two or more of these, then whichever takes higher precedence or which is higher in hierarchy will be what
action is taken, regardless of what order it is written.
This code:
     <title>Hello</title>
        <style>
            ul > li {
                color: blue;
            }
        </style>

        means that only the list items or "children" or 'descendants' of unordered lists will be blue. 'Direct children only' is denoted by the greater than symbol. If there 
        is a UL that immediately contains an LI within it, then I would like for that to be colored blue.
        If there was no greater than symbol, then all descending elements would be affected.
An 'a' means anchor tag.
a[href="https://facebook.com"] {
                color: red;
            }
        Only what's inside the square brackets will be changed to the color red.
