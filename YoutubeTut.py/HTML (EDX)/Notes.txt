Css works inside of html, meaning in the same logic or code you write for html, you CAN use CSS's "properties" (like HTML's attributes). These properties are colors, transitions, etc.
    See style.html for the example on how to write this.
        You can also create a .css file to apply properties to multiple webpages. This file, however, cannot be opened as a webpage like you could a an HTML file.
    You would need to link this .css file to your html file.
        See style.html and styles.css

'Padding' is space for elements
'Margin' will move the entire element you are constructing and add space around the element and keep spacing for other nearby elements.
Css can change fonts as well. when using 'font-family' use commas to separate and specify different fonts for backup fonts just in case a user's web browser doesn't support the
font you've listed.
    'font-weight' specifies boldness maybe even italic.
Borders can be specified like this for example:
    border: 3px solid black;
