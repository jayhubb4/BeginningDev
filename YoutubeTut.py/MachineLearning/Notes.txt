Steps in machine learning:

1. Imprort the data
2. Clean the data
3. Split the data into Training/Test sets
4. Create a model
5. Train the model
6. Make Predictions
7. Evaluate Predictions and Improve

Libraries Needed:
Numpy - Multi-dimensional array
Pandas - data analysis library
MatPlotLib - 2D library for creating graphs and plots
Scikit-Learn - Provides common algorithms


Jupyter Notebook extension is what you will use for machine learning.
Kaggle.com is what we can use to form data sets. You'll download whichever data set you need.
