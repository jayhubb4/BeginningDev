Steps in machine learning:

1. Imprort the data
2. Clean the data
3. Split the data into Training/Test sets
4. Create a model
5. Train the model
6. Make Predictions
7. Evaluate Predictions and Improve

Libraries Needed:
Numpy - Multi-dimensional array
Pandas - data analysis library
MatPlotLib - 2D library for creating graphs and plots
Scikit-Learn - Provides common algorithms
